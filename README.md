the radial representation reqpresent the bins of frequencies, with the scaled frequencies radiating out from the center, and the sound is type of 'fax' dial up for the groups connection

vibrations on a string become looking a lot more like cash-in-transit gateways for windowed particles, where status equates to a repair on investment metric

in this version of fluent-pad, I removed the in-memory history, because I was experiencing node error on limit hits, what’s left is the user list

Thinking of Ohm reduction limits via CID particles when measuring eletromotive forces of carbon lifeforms, with stored energy via optimal flow state for modal state transition

trees becoming coil like spirit totems for informational decentralized compression resistance using curatorial mechanisms of like-frequencies
