Some off thoughts using fog-fax to visualize the radial heart in a type of spiritual waiting room of a groups cognition aggregate

![radial-vibrations](./radial-vibrations.gif)

the radial representation reqpresent the bins of frequencies, with the scaled frequencies radiating out from the center, and the sound is type of 'fax' dial up for the groups connection

vibrations on a string become looking a lot more like cash-in-transit gateways for windowed particles, where status equates to a repair on investment metric

in this version of fluent-pad, I removed the in-memory history, because I was experiencing node error on limit hits, whatâ€™s left is the user list

Thinking of Ohm reduction limits via CID particles when measuring eletromotive forces of carbon lifeforms, with stored energy via optimal flow state for modal state transition

trees becoming coil like spirit totems for informational decentralized compression resistance using curatorial mechanisms of like-frequencies


## integrations & software distribution
experimenting with the idea of distributing a dapp on urbit with the 2 networks integrated. 

Q: why is this a bad idea? network of urbit & the network of fluence coming together as a way to not clog a network of data packets, while also keeping the fundamentals of a p2p network in check.

bands of frequency from brain computer interface data can be assigned fractional NFT, which can be integrated in a timely ritual POAP using %gora.
